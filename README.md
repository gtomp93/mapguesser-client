**MapBattles**

Welcome to MapBattles. This website was built using React, vanilla CSS, Node, MongoDB, AWS S3 for cloud storage and Auth0 for Authentication. It uses the Google Maps and Google Places APIs, as well as lodash for debouncing and React Spring for animation easing.

In this game, users are shown Google Map street views, guess the locations on a world map and are assigned a score based on the guess distance. All game progress is saved. Players can leave their games and come back any time if they are signed up. Even guests who are not signed in can come back to their most recently played game.

Games can be timed or untimed and played in competitive multiplayer mode with friends or in single player mode.In multiplayer mode, users can see the other players' guesses on the map and compare scores at the end of the game.

Users can build their own Maps that other users can play. Users can also "like" and "comment" on one another's maps.
